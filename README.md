# AutoDenovo

The goal in this project is to construct a pipeline for finding denovo mutations related to neurodevelopmental disorders using family study designs, similar to pipelines previously developed for cancer research. It combines different types of variants by multiple callers, and uses both chip and exome sequencing data.
